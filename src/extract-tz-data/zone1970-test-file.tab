# tz zone descriptions
#
# This file is in the public domain.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2017-10-01):
# This file contains a table where each row stands for a zone where
# civil time stamps have agreed since 1970.  Columns are separated by
# a single tab.  Lines beginning with '#' are comments.  All text uses
# UTF-8 encoding.  The columns of the table are as follows:
#
# 1.  The countries that overlap the zone, as a comma-separated list
#     of ISO 3166 2-character country codes.  See the file 'iso3166.tab'.
# 2.  Latitude and longitude of the zone's principal location
#     in ISO 6709 sign-degrees-minutes-seconds format,
#     either +-DDMM+-DDDMM or +-DDMMSS+-DDDMMSS,
#     first latitude (+ is north), then longitude (+ is east).
# 3.  Zone name used in value of TZ environment variable.
#     Please see the theory.html file for how zone names are chosen.
#     If multiple zones overlap a country, each has a row in the
#     table, with each column 1 containing the country code.
# 4.  Comments; present if and only if a country has multiple zones.
#
# If a zone covers multiple countries, the most-populous city is used,
# and that country is listed first in column 1; any other countries
# are listed alphabetically by country code.  The table is sorted
# first by country code, then (if possible) by an order within the
# country that (1) makes some geographical sense, and (2) puts the
# most populous zones first, where that does not contradict (1).
#
# This table is intended as an aid for users, to help them select time
# zone data entries appropriate for their practical needs.  It is not
# intended to take or endorse any position on legal or territorial claims.
